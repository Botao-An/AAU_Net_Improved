# AAU-Net

1. We provide the **improved** code for paper "**Adversarial Algorithm Unrolling Network for Interpretable Mechanical Anomaly Detection**".

   

2. Compared with the original **Code**[https://github.com/Botao-An/AAU_Net], we improved the loss functions of AAU-Net and solved the problem of instability during training. The referred paper is "**Wasserstein Auto-Encoders**"

   

3. The code is originally debugged on the computer with the following configuration.

   |          Hardware           |    Software    |     Software      |
   | :-------------------------: | :------------: | :---------------: |
   |  Intel Core i7-10700KF CUP  | Anaconda 4.9.2 |     CUDA 11.7     |
   |          RAM 32GB           |   Python 3.8   |    cuDNN 8.4.0    |
   | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 GPU | PyTorch 1.8.1  | TorchVision 0.9.1 |



3. We give a demo of simulation for you to test the performance of AAU-Net initially.

   

4. To run the model, you should firstly prepare the dataset in a standard format as the simulated one. More details can be found in file **pre and post processing.ipynb**. Then you can run AAU-Net by file **train.py**. To check and visulize the results, you can use **pre and post processing.ipynb** again.
